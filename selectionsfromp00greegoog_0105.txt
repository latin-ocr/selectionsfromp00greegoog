Philemon and Baucis. [Manu.

XII. Pareamou aar> Baucrs.

[Boox V111.-620-724]

[Halieuma returning from the Calydonian liunt, is entertained
with his frIends by the river-god Achelous, who recounts the fate of
certain nymphe, turned into rocks and islands. These prodigies
are mocked by Pirithous, son of Ixion, who is among them. To
silence his cavil, Lelex relates the following tale (589-619).]

Jupiter and Mercury, journeying once in Phrygia, were refused
hospitality by all the inhabitants ofa certain place, except two
pious rustics‚ Philemon and his wife Baucis, who provide such
entertainment as they are able (620-688). While the inhospitable
town was drowned in a marsh, the poor hut of Philemon became
a temple, of which he and his wife were made attendants3 until in
agood old age they were both transformed to trees, he to an oak
and she to a linden (689-724).

ILIAE contermina quercus
collibus est Phrygiis, modico circumdata muro. ’
haud procul huic stagnum est, tellus habitabilis olim,
nunc celebres mergis fulicisque palustribus undae. 625
Juppiter huc specie mortali, cumque parente
venit Atlantiades, positis caducifer alis.
mille domos adiere, locum requiemque petentes:
mille domos clausere serae. Tamen una recepit,
parva quidem, stipulis et canna tecta palustri: ⁶30
sed pia Baucis anus parilique aetate Philemon
illa sunt annis juncti juvenilibus, illa
consenuere casa; paupertatemque fatendo
effecere levem, nec iniqua mente ferendo.
nec refert, dominos illic, famulosne requiras: 6³5
tota domus duo sunt, idem parentque jubentque.
Ergo ubi caelicolae parvos tetigere penateS, ⁴
summissoque humiles intrarunt vertice postes,
membra senex posito jussit relevare sedili,
