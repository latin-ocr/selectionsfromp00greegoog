of association,-sometimes by what seems merely the poet’s
artifice, aiming to make a· coherent tale out of the vast miscellany
at his command*

λ With the primitive (fetichistic) notion of a separate life in
every object, and tue human soul differing in no essential regard
from the life that dwells in things, it was easy to imagine the spirit
of man, beast, or plant as passing from one dwelHng to another, for Ι
a longer or shorter stay. Such a transmigration was, in fact,
taught as a creed by the school of Pythagoras (see Metam. xv.
1-487). But, as against the Hindoo doctrine of transmigration
into the very life of other animale, the Greeks held to the identity
and continuity of the human soul, which after death had its abode
assigned in the Lower World. The metamorphosis, therefore, μ
is only an occasional miracle‚ not a real metempsychosis,·† it did
not alter essentially the ordinary course of human life,- but only
marked the intimate connection between that and the life of
external nature;.or, in a certain wild, pictorial way, showed the
workings of human fancy, to account for the first creation of plants
and animals, or other striking phenomena of the natural world, -a
clear water-spring ina little island (Arethusa),a mountain ridge
of peculiar shape (Atlas), a bird of plaintive note (Philomela), or
arock weeping with perpetual springs (Niobe).

To give something like system, order, and development to this,
world of fable seems to have been a favorite aim of poetical com-
position with the ancients. This aim is partly religious, and partly
scientific,-if that can be called scientific which only filis with
fancies a void that no science yet exists to fill. Thus the ‘⁴ Theo-
gony” of Hesiod groups together'the myths relating to the birth
of gods and heroes -making a sort of pagan ‘⁴ Genesis ”—in a
form partly chronological, partly pictoresque and poetical. This

l Thus the princess lo is changed into a heifer (Met. i. 611). She retains her human
consciousness, deplores the change, and writes her own name on the saud, to inform her
father of it. This is metamorphosis, or change of form. According to the oriental
doctrine taught by Pythagoras (Met. xv. 459), the heifer in your stall was doubtless once a
human being, perhaps your own mother or sister: it would be wicked to kill her, and
impious to eat her tlesh. But she has only a brute conscionsness3 and simply sharcs the
universal life ot man and brute· This is metempsychosis, or change of sout
