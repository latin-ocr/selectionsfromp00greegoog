Gnnrcnunn‚—In eeknowledging the receipt from you oi a copy oi Allen
end Greenough's Virgss, allow me to express my appreciation oi its supe-
rior men'ts us u textbcok. 1 have been particularly pleesel with the Intro-
ductions to the Bueolies ond the AEneid, and the good judgment end teste
exhibited in the notes, which in their rendering of many passages so well
illustrate what the editors themselves recall to the attention oi the pupil,
that in translating, poetry requires “e more precise, virid, end picturesque
use of words then prose.’'

From Fisk P. Brewer, Professor of Greek.

the notes ol' preceding volumes oi tire series, end ure tuffleichtly soil.

Ι oni greatly pleused with your edition of virgtt. 'i’he notes are oi the
right kind. The translations, too, are not merely mutate in pointel
scholarship, but are also expressed in good, idiometie English-on exrel-
lenec much too rere. It is in every wey every attractive edition.
