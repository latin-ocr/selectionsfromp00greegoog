NOTES.

Is is supposed that most classes who read Ovid at all, will read
Ovid before any other Latin ‘poet3 and as it is desirable that a
poetical composition should always be read as verse, -that is, with
a knowledge of its rhythmieal structure,-a lew directions will
here be given for scanning at sight or by ear3 which, with a little
practice, will be found an easy, almost mechanical process.

Itis necessary, frrst, for the learner to understand the nature
of the verse, as depending on precisely the same principles as tlie
rhythmical divisions of a piece of music (§ 7⁷); als0‚ to be familiar
withthe general rules of Quantity and Accent(§§ 3, 4).* Besides
this, the teacher should explain and illustrate, so far as may be
necessary, the structure of the hexameter (ξ 82, a), reading from
the text of the poem itself‚ until its peculiar movement has become
familiar to the learner's ear. lt will now be observed- ’

1. That the difficulties in scanning lie almost entirely in tlte
first leals os llrev verse. With very rare exceptionS, the last two
feet, and generally the last three, are accented in verse exactly as
they would be in prose: thetis, the Arsis (first syllable) of the
foot corresponds with the natural or prose accent of the word.

2. That in hexameter verse tlte thirdfool (rarely the fourth
instead) regularly begins wt'tlr tlte last syllable of a word. Thus,
while the last half of a verse is almost always accented as in prose,
the first half very seldom is. The slight pause interrupting the
foot at the end of the word is called a coesural pause (§ ⁷9. 5);
and is the most important point that distinguishes the movement
of verse from that of prose. The pause in the third foot (less
commonly the fourth) usually corresponds with a pause in the
sense, and is called the principal caesura.

3. That whenever a short syllable occurs in the verse, llere
must be a dactyl. This becomes a most convenient sule, as soon
as the pronunciation of even-the commonest words is known, in

'To these it may be well to add the quantity of final syllables (ἃ 78, 2). The
learner should also be habituated to au aestuate pronunciation of words according to their
prose accent. ’
