186 Ι Notos: Ooid. [Marah.

all cases where there are words of more than two syllables3 for
thus a short syllable will often serve as a key to the entire structure
of the verse. ⁴

For examples‚ we will take the first four lines of the poem.

1. In novofert dnz'mns mutdlos dlcere formas.

Here the last three words are scanned exactly as they'read:
multatas Ι dicere Ι formas. Of the others, antinus shows by its
aecent that the i of the penult is short; and, as its last syllable
must belong to the following word, nothing more is needed to show
that the verse will scan as follows :-
In nbva Ι fert anllmus ΙΙ multatas Ι dicere Ι formas3

and the quantity of the other syllables is shown at once by their
position in the verse. Ι

2. Corpora: Di, captis-nam vos mutastis et illas-

The first word corpora, being a dactyl, at once gives a correct start to

the verse. The second foot, Dz‘coep-—is equally plain,as aspondee3

and after this beginning, the rest of the verse scans of itself z - ⁷
Corpora: Ι Di, coepitis ΙΙ -nam Ι vos multastts et Ι illas.

3. Adspirate καῖε,- primaque ab origine mnndi.

The first word, adspirate, is nearly as clear, as, when we remember
either the pronunciatien of odtplro or the quantity of the o of the
first conjugation, we see that it contains three long syllables, a
spondee and the beginning ofa dactyl. The last three feet are
pronouncecl exactly as in prose (observing the elision) z -
Αάερῑὲιᾶῐέ metim Ι priimaqu' {ab blriglne Ι mundi.

4 Aa mea perpetuum dedncz'te tlmpora carmen. Ι
Here the three last words form aperfect metrical series; and the
only difficulty in the verse is caused by the ictus coming on the
first syllable of perpetuum, while the accent is on the second.

Ad mea Ι ρειρέῖῠΙιιιιι Ι delduclte Ι tempora Ι carmen.

These directions would be sufficient for all or nearly all cases*
if it were not for the frequent elision of the last syllable of words:
viz.‚ in general, whcnever o word ending in a vowel ,or in ιιι is ⁴
followed byn word beginning wz'llt a vowel or wath h. This
makes the commonest and most annoying of the obstacles to be
met, and requires the beginner to be constantly on the watch. If
he will now carefully compare the following lines, as metrically
divided‚ with the rules which have been given above, it is hoped
that he will. have little difficulty hereafter.

¹¹ lt will be observed that, of the first twenty verses of the poem, only tlte ath and rsth
lack the cossura in the third soot: while in the roth. rssth, and roth tlte principal pause is
in the fourth foot instead ol the third.
