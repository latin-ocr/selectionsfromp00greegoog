[Boou V·-341÷5⁶1·]

[Au the marriage feast of Perseus¹ aud Andromeda, her¹ uncle
Phineus,- to whom she had been betrothed, out'of jealousy caused
aquarrel among the guests3 and a violent quarrel arising thence,
with bloodshed on both sides, Perseus, by showing the Gorgon⁷s
head, suddenly turned into stone Phineus himself, with two hundred
of his companions (V. 1-235), And by the¹ same rneaus, after his¹
return to Argos, his enemies Proetus and Polydectes were likewise
converted into stone (236-249). Minerva (who had attended Per-
seus thus far), coming to Helicon and inquiring of the Muses, is

, told the following: that having taken refuge from a tempest with
Pyreneus of Daulia, inPhoois, and he offering them violence, they
were changed to birds; aud he, attemptingflight after them, was
dashed in pieces (aso-293). The Pierides, daughters of king
PieruS‚ of Macedonia, having challenged them io a trial of skill,
begin with the tale of the giant sons of Earth, who attempted to
scale Olympus ; the terror of the gods before Typhoeus, und the
various shapes they assumed in their fiight3 to which ‘the Muses
respond by relating the Wandering of Ceres in her search for her
daughter Proserpine (294-340).] ’

When the monster Typhoeus had been buried beneath Mount
AEtna‚ Pluto, god of the world below, alarmed at the convulsions
caused by his agony, came forth to view. Now Venus had been
jealous at the virginity of Proserpine, Ceres’ daughter3 and at her
bidding Cupid shot the king of Shadows with his dart. He then,
beholding Proserpine, as she sported with her maidens in the vale
of Enna, seized her, and bore her away in his chariot, driving his
way through the fouut of Cyane, who thereou was herself con-
verted into water (341-437). Seeking her daughter in vain, by the
light of torches kindled from AEtna, Ceres turned into a sported .
lizard (stellio) the boy Stelles, who had mocked her eager thirst3
and into a horned owl Ascalaphus who testified to having seen
Proserpine in Hades eat seven pomegranate-seeds‚ whereby she
was compelled to remain in her new abode. Meanwhile, the
virgin—companions of Proserpine became winged Sirens. And,

by favor of Jupiter, Proserpine was permitted to pass half the year
with her mother, and half 'with her wedded lord (438-567).
