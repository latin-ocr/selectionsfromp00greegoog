2 Introduction io ibe

whose family history or personal adventures became the subject
of tales absolutely devoid of any symbolical meaning. ln the
system found in the Greek and Roman poets‚ nature is full of
mythological beings, grouped - as subjects in a monarchy — about
the one celestial or royalfamily, which has its abode on Mount

Olympus. The King of Heaven, Zeus (Jupz'ter), with his sister·
queen Hnnn (June), is the child of Knonos (Satura) or Time,

who again is the son of Ounnrvos and Gn1n (Heaven and Earth),
beyond which imagination did not seek to go. His brothers are
Posnnon (Neptune) and HABES (Pluto), kings of the Waters and
of the Lower World. His sisters are Dennrnn (Ceres) and HESTIA
(Vesta), queens of the Harvest and oi the Home. His sons are
ΑΡοιιο, god of Light, Anns (Mars) of Strife, and Hennes,
(Mercury) the Herald. His daughters are ΑΤΗΕΝΕ (Minerva),
Arnnomrn (Venus), and Anrnnts (Druna), goddesses of Wis-
dom, of Love‚ and of the Chase. These are the twelve great
divinities (dii majores). And about them, in nearer or remoter
kindred, are grouped the inferior deities, the heroes or demigods,
their children by half-mortal parentage‚ and the innumerable

“ progeny of fabulous beings inhabiting the kingdoms of sky,
’ water, or earth.

The other department of mythology is that with which this poem
chiefly deals. lt consists of the miracles and adventures ascribed
to these superhuman persons, - a vast field, in which ancient fancy
rioted as freely as the modern fancy in novels and fairy-tales.
Some of them may possibly be explained as a picturesqt'te way
of recounting natural phenomena, or as exaggerated tales of real
events. But in general they seem purely fictions of the imagina-
tion. ln a very large proportion they take the form of metamor·
pheses, that is, transformations of men or other creatures into
various shapes3 and this feature gives the subject and the title of
the present poem (see the first lines of Book l.). lt professes
simply to tell those stories which have in them this element of the
marvellous‚—the transfonnations, particularly, of men into plants
or animals. But as nearly all myths introduce some such feature,
first or last, it manages to include nearly all the important ones
with more or less fnlness. They are told in a rambling discursive
way, one story leading to another by the slightest possible link
