Wrruuunwu apart from the love of women, and, having
gathered by his song a grove of forest trees [among them the piue
which was once the youth Attis, and Cyparissus changed by Apollo
into a Cypress], Orpheus siugs of the loves of the gods for mortal
men. And first of Ganymede of Troy, borneto heaven by Jupiter
iu the form of au eagle (143-161); and of Hyacinthum a beautiful
youth of Sparta, beloved by Apollo, but accidentally killed by him
with a discus (or quoit) that he had hurled into the air3 from
whose blood sprang the flower that bears his name (162-219).

[He further siugs of certain people of Cyprus, cruel to
strangers, who by Venus were changed to oxeu (220-237); of the

· statue wrought by Pygmalion, which became a living maideu, and

his bride (243-297); of Myrrha, who because of her incestuous love
of her father became a tree weeping fragrant gum (298-502); of ¹her
child Adonis, loved by Venus (5035 59) ; of Atalanta, ileet of foot,
who was won in the race by craft of Hippomanes with three golden
appler, but both were afterwards changed into lions (560-707);
and of the death of Adonim slain by a wild boar, aud by Venus
converted into the flower Anemoue, as Menthe had aforetime been
by Proserpine into the herb Mint (708-739).]
