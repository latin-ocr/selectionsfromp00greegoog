[Amono the creatures generated from the soil of the earth after
the Deluge, had been the serpent Python, slaln by Apollo, who
thereon instituted the Pythian games: the prize of victory, first
the oak-leaf, was afterwards the laurei, sacred to Apollo, being the
nymph Daphne, loved by him, and changed to that form to escape
his pursuit.-Io, daughter of the river-god Inachus, beloved by
Jupiter, is changed into a heifer by him, to escape the jealousy of .
Juno; but is put by her in charge of Argus of the hundred eyes,
who being soothed to sleep by Mercury-who sings the story of
Syrinx converted'to a water-reed to avoid the pursuit of Pan -is

and appeal (47-102). He mounts, and attempts the celestial way:

(103-205). Terror and devastation caused by the fiery chariot:
blasting of mountains and rivers, and alarm of Neptune himself ;
Earth appeals to Jupiter, who blasts Phaethon with a thunderbolt
(206-324). His sisters are converted to poplars, and their tears
to amber (325-366); while his kinsman Cygnus, bewailing the
calamity, becomes a Swan (367—380). The Suo, in grief and wrath,
hides his head from the earth; but, entreated by the gods and
commanded by Jupiter, collects again his scattered steeds, to
resume their wonted course (381-400).
