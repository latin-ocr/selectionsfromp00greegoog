[Ducnrvme the daughters of PeliaS, Jason’s enemy, by a
similar miracle wrought upon an aged ram, Medea brings about
their fathe'r’s death (VII. 297-349). Escaping by means of winged
dragous, aud passing over the scene of many transformationS,
Medea comes to Athens; whence (her attempted poisoning of
Theseus being foiled by the recognition of his father AEgeus) she
suddenly vanishes (350-424). A feast is celebrated in honoros
Theseus’ exploits 3 and hostility ensuing with Minos (Europa's son) -
of Crete, Cephalus is sent as envoy to AEgina3 to whom the agad
AEacus relates the marvellous transformation of ants to men (called
Myrmidono), after his realm had been ravaged by pestilence (425-
660). Now Cephalus had received from his wife Procris a hound
and a dart that never missed its aim3 and, as he delighted greatly
in hunting, Procris being jealous watched him from a thicket; and
' he, taking it for the movement of some wild creature, shot her with
that dart which was her own gift (eor-865). MinoS, making war
on Athens to avenge the slaying of his son Androgeos comes first ,
to Megara ; where Scylla, daughter os the king Nisus, out of love
sor Minos cuts the purple lock on which her father's kingdom and
life depend. Disdained by Minos, she is changed to a sea-mew,
and Nisus to an osprey (VIII. 1-151).]

Theseus, in his escape from the Cretan labyrinth, had borne
away Ariadne, daughter of Minos; who, sorsaken by him, is com-
forted by Bacchus, who sets her coronet among the stars (152-182).
Daedalus, builder of the labyrinth, being imprisoned, escapes with
his son lcarus by means of wings fastened with wax; but Icarus,
soaring too near the sun, and the wax melting, falls into the sea
named for him (183-234). His fallis gladly seen by Perdix, once
sister’s son to Daedalus, and slain by him out of envy, but changed
by Minerva to a partridge (235-259).
