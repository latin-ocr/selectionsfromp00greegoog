Tms Selection follows generally the textos Merkel (1866), the
reading of Siebelis being preferred in one or two instances. We

have endeavored to exhibit as sar as possible within our limits the ’

variety of Ovid's style and genius, and especially to preserve the
more interesting biographical hints of the Amores and the Tristia.
The greater portion of the book is however made up, necessarily,
from the Metamorphoses, of which we have taken about a third.
By help of the Argument‚ which is given in full, we aim not merely
to show the connection of the tales and the ingenuity ol the transi·
tions,-necessary to comprehend¹ the poem as a whole-but to
put before the reader something like a complete picture of the
Greek mythology3 at least of those narratives which have held

their permanent place in the modern mind and 'have entered more

or less into every modern literature.
' The grammatical references are to Allen and Greenough's and
Gildersleeve’s Latin Grammars.
