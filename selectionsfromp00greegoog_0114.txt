Χ. 7.] Orpheus and Eurydice.

XIV. anneus Aru> Euuvmcu.

[Boou X.-1-77.]

[Aucuuurq mother of Hercules, to entertain Iole (who had
married his son Hyllus), relates the tale oi Hercules’ birth, which
was long delayed, but at last brought about by the artifice os Galan-
this, a waiting maid; who, for the falsehood she told, was turned
into aweasel by Ilithyia, whom she had deceived (IX. 273-323i·
lole relatos in turn of her sister Dryope, changed to a lotus
(324-339). The restoring os Iolaus to youth, aud the miraculous
manhood bestowed on the children of Callirhoe, having moved the
displeasure of some os the godS, Jupiter reminds them of the pain-
lul old age of his own son Minos (400-442). The tale is told of '
Byblis, daughter of Miletus (who had migrated from Crete to Asia):
she, filled with a guilty love ior her brother CannuS, became a foun-
tain in Caria (443-665). lphis, daughter of Ligdus of Crete, having
been brought up as a youth to avoid her father's displeasure that a
daughter was born to him, was at length changed to a young man
by Isis, and so became the husband os Ianthe (666-797).]

Hymen, proceeding to Thrace, after the marriage of Iphis,
unites Orpheus to Eurydice, but not happily, ior she died from the
bite of a serpent To recover her, Orpheus penetrated the shadows ’
of the Lower World, where even the F uries are moved to tears at
song, the torments of hell are stayed‚ and Proserpine is won to
yield him back his wife, only on condition that he shall not look
behind him till again in the upper world. Turning about too soon,
iu his eagerness to see her, he loses her again, and is not suffered
a second time to enter Hades (X. 1-77).

INDE per immensum croceo velatus amictu

aethera digreditur, Ciconumque Hymenaeus ¹ud

oras

tendit, et Orphea nequiquam voce vocatur.
adfuit ille quidem; sed nec sollemnia verba,
nec laetos vultus, nec felix attulit omen. ς
sax quoque, quam tenuit, lacrimoso stridula sumo
usque suit, nullosque invenit motibus ignee.
