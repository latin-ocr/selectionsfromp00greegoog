[As the chiefs marvel at this prodigy, Nestor relates of Caeneus,
once a maiden (Caenis), but made into an invulnerable man, who
was present when the nuptial feast of Pirithous and Hippodamia
was disturbed by the battle of the Lapithae and the Centauts. For
the Centaurs‚ monsters of vast strength and fury, half-man, half-
horse, had attempted to steal away the bride. And Caeneus,
remaining unhurt through the fight, was at length overwhelmed
with vast piles of trees, and transformed by Neptune to an eagle
(XII. 146-535). The son of Hercules, Tlepolemus, tells also of
Periclymenus, slain by Hercules as he flew against him in the form
of an eagle (536-579). At the request of Neptune, whose son
Cygnus had been slain, Apollo guides the arrow of Paris to the
vulnerable heel of Achilles3 so that he dies, and a strife arises
among the other chiefs who shall receive his armor, the rival
claimants being Ajax and Ulysses (580-62'8).]

Ajax maintains his claim, before the assembled chiefs, first as of
nobler descent, and then by his martial explode, chiefly the defenee
of the Grec‘ian fleet; at the same time scorning the strategy of
Ulysses, and asserting that himself alone has might to wield the
immortal armour (1-122). To which Ulysses replies‚ that his own
counsel had been most effective in the siege, and his own acts most
essential, especially in the night attack of the tents of Rhesus, and
the carrying away of the Palladium (123-381). To him the victory .
is judged; and Aiax, in ungovernable wrath, slays himself with
his own sword,-the flower hyacinth springing from his blood

(382-398)·

ONSEDERE duces, et vulgi stante corona

surgit ad hos clipei dominus septemplicis Ajax.
utque erat impatiens irae, Sigeia torvo
litora respexit, classemque in litore vultu,
intendensque manus, ‘ Agimus, pro Juppiter l ’ inquit ς
‘ ante rates causam, et mecum confertur Ulixesl
at non Hectoreis dubitavit cedere flammis,
