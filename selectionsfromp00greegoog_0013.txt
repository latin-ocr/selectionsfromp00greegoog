the emperor at some weakness, lolly, or fault, which he says
he is not free to tell. Some have thought he was indiscreet
enough to make love to Julia, the brilliant, witty, and erratio
daughter of the emperor, mlle of tlte grave “Agrippa 3 others
that he unfortunately knew too much of some court scanrlal,
probably connected with Julia or her ill-iamed and ill-lated
daughter3 others that Augustus, as public patron: uf morals,
took offence at the somewhat cynieal indecorum of certain
oi his poems. At· any rate, the emperor was hardenecl
against all his flatteries and prayers, and after an exile ot
about ten years he died at Tomi, n. n. 18.

Besides the 'poems represented in this volume, Ovid was
’ the author oi‘the Ars Amatoria· and, th'e Remedium Amoris
(to which reference has just been made), and ol numerous
“Elegies,'’ including four books 'of letters written in exile
(Ex Ponto Limite). As a poet, his lame islar below that
ol Virgil and Horace, - deservedly, since his loose and easy
verse bears no 'comparison with the elaborate finish oi theirs.
For lancy and fine poetic feeling, however, many ol the
Elegies -both in the Tristia and the Amores - show a vein
of as good quality as either ol his rivals3 while in absolute
ease of handling the artificial structure ol Latin verse it may
be doubted whether he has ever lta'd an equal. His chief
merit, however, is 'as au excellent story-teller,-'smooth‚
facile, fluent, sometimes, it must be confessed, inordinately
diffuse. As the most celebrated existing collection of the
most famous {ables of the ancient world, tlte Metamorphoses,
in particular, makes the best ol introductione to the nobler
and more difficolt verse of Virgil.
