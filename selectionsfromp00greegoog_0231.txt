Acmslus, king of Argos, had been warned that he should be
dethroned and sinin by the child of his daughter Danae, whom
therefore, to elude the oracle, he conrined in a dungeon with brazen
walls. But Jupiter gained admission in the form of a shower ol
gold, and Dana'e' became the mother oi Perseus. Being shut with
the child- then four years of age -in a obest, or coffer‚ and cast
into the sea, she drifted to the island oi Seriphus, where the boy
grew up, and was sent craftily by the tyrant oi the island ior the
head oi the Gorgon Medusa. In this enterprise he was helped
and delivered by the friendly care oi the divinities Mercury and
Minerva, who armed him lor bis taslr, gave him the power oi night,
and made him invulnerable and invincible. (See, sor an admirable
narrative oi the adventure, Kingsley's “Heroes‚'' and “Andro-
meda.'’) ’
