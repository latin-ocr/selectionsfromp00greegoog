Messes. Grnu Bnoruens:

Gesnanstmr‚-·llaving used Goodwin’s Greek Grammar, and Allen and
Grecuough's Latin Grammnr, published by you, 1 take pleesnre in mering
testimony to their superior merite es school books. Forelass instruction
they have, in my opinion, no equals. All tha necessary facts und principles
of the Latin and Greek Lnnguugcs ure stated and illustrated so plainly and
clearly, yet in so briff a eompass, thot studente will find everything easy of
comprehension end application, and be relievcd from the unneeessary detail
lound' ιιι many school grammate.

The‘ ‘Latin cnd Greek Lessonsss 'by Prof. Leighton, ιιι-ο excellent coln·
panions os these grcmmers, and will be found containing all ssrctle neces·
sery to prepare e student to read Caesar or Xenophon with ease. 1 lind
the other books of your Latin and Greek series, nemcly, Goedwin's Greek
chder‚ Allcn's Latin composition, Allen aud Grecnough's Latin Seiae·
tions end Cicero, exhibiting ell the accurate scholarship and rhorough adap-
terion to school work which we should expect from their distinguished
authors.

As publishers, you deserve not only great credit lor the judgment yon
have displayed in the selection of your editorial corps, but also in the ncca-
recy of the printing, end the general character ol the mechanieal work.

Garunnae—lior moro than two years we hare used Allen and Grecn-
ough's Latin Giarrnnar end Leighton’s Latin Lessons with perfect satisfac·
tiou. Before subjecting the grammor to the test of daily class use 1 was
greatly pleased with the evidence of ripe scholarsltip end familiarity with
latest results of philologieal resenrch which it everywhere exhibilcd. Since
then three large classes have brought out its excellencies in derad. The
Lessons by lllr. Leighton show his sull comprehensiou of the qualities of
the Grammar as well as thc wants ol beginners in the noble Latin tongue.
