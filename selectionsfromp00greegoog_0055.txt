[Orthe family of Cadmus, Actaeon, having beheld Diana as
she was bathing with her nymphs, was changed by her into a stag,
and torn in pieces by his own hounds (lll. 138-252). Semele
became the mother of Bacchus, but was destroyed by the' presence
of Jupiter, whom she desired to see clothed with flames and munder
(253-31 5). Tiresias, the Theban seer, is made blind, but endowed
with prophecy (316-338). The nymph Echo, pining with love of
Narcissus, becomes a rock, her voice alone surviving (339-401);
while Narcissus, gazing on his image in a fountain, perishes, and
by the water-nymphs is converted to a fiower (40²·5¹0)· Pen-
theus, having denied the god Bacchus, and forbidden his solem·
nities, and caused him to be seized, is torn in pieces by-Bacchanals‚
his mother and sistens aiding: Bacchus meanwhile (in the form ol
Acaetes) relates the miracle wrought by himself upon a Tyrrhenian
crew, whose ship’s tackle he had converted to serpents, and them·
selves to dolphins (511-733). Three Theban sisters (Minyeides)
likewise refrain from the rites of Bacchus: of whom one relates the
tale of Pyramus and Thisbe (lv. 1-54)].

These young lovers, dwelling in Babylon, had appointed a
meeting at the tomb of king Ninus (55-92). Thisbe, coming
first, is terrified by a lion and so escapes. PyramuS, soon arriving,
finds tracks of the beast and the torn mantle of Thisbe; and con·
ceiving that she is slain, stabs himself with his sword, his blood
reddening the fruit of the mulberry‚-at whose foot he lies (93-127).
Thisbe, soon returning‚ finds him dying, and slays herself with the
’ sword yet warm (128-166).
