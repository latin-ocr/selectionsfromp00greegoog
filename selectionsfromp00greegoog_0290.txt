of his banishment‚ and we can account for the discrepancy only by
supposing that he reckoned the Olympiad at five years, an almost

inconceivable blunder. Mommsen> explains it, however (Rom.
chron. p. 170). by calling attention to the confusion of the ancients

themselves in regard to the expression quinto quoque antro, sor the
period in the Julian calendar: “the poet‚’' he says, “rightly sup·
posed that the Olympiad and the Julian lustra [decem lustris perac-
tis, Ibis. 1]‚ were of equal length, and very wrongly supposed the
latter to be five years.’'
