Ι. Tne ettennon nnn ann Fnoon.

v. 1. In nova . . . corpora. At first sight it would seem that
it ought to be corpora mutata in novas formas. But formas and
corpora mean nearly the same thing: the forms are changed and
so the bodies are new. - animus, tlte soul‚· hence often the inclina-
tion. — fert, impels [me] (a standing expression). - dicere, depends
on fert ammeta, as an expression of wishing (5 57, 8, d,· G. 424).

2. emptis, efforts: lit. thtirgs begua-et, too, belonging with
vos: Vou too have changed (your forms).

3. mundi, tlte universe, or system of tln'ngs,· a word having
the original sense (like the Greek alopas) ol order or beautjr.

4. perpetuum carmen, uninterrupted song, implying the intro·
duction of the later (ltalian) myths, along with the Greek.

6. orbe, sphera ol space: more strictly, orbis is aflat disk,
which was the ancient poetic notion of the “circle ³' of being.

7. chaos: this word is from the same root as the Greek χαίνω,
yawn=tlze yawrling void-moles. decep, as of elementS, or
materials, chance-piled together.-ne0 quiequam, and nothing,
the negative and connective being combined as usual.

8. iners, i. e.‚ lacking the skill (are) to combine them. - eodem,
into the same place (5 41, 1, s, and 2, a).

10—14. Titan, Phoebe, bellus, Amphitrite=Sun‚ Maon, Barth,
Sea. As the last of the old nature-divinities (Yt'tans), the Sun
sometimes retains this name in poetry: ·

Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butten?
