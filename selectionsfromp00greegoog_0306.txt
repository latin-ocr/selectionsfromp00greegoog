From Sam’l Hert, Prof. of Latin in 'l'rinity Collega.

Messes. eru Bnornnns:

descientia-Now that you have published the complete introductory
Latin course of Messrs. Allcn and Greeuough, 1 am glad to h'ave an oppor-
tunity of sayiug of it as a whole what I have already said of the Grammar
and the editions of Caesar, Sallust, Cicero and virgil, as each appeared,-
that it is by lar the best series os the kind that 1 have ever had tho oppor-
tunity of examining. A bcy who follows the course of study which it
marks out for him will not only lay firm foundations, but also go far towards
gaining an ample knowledge of the philology, the history, and the literature
of tho Latin language. His after-work will not oblige him to unlearn any·
thing that he has been taught, and he will be able to apply general prin·
ciplcs to illustrate his later studies. Itis pleasant to know that the series
is so weh appreciated, and Ι congratulate both you and the authors on your
success.

Atnnnr, April aeth, idle.

After using, with classes, both Harkuess' and Andrews and Stoddard’s
Latin Grammars‚I examiued carefully Alleu aud Greenough's Latin
Grammar. The syntax is masterly. The work, ia all its parts, gives the
results of the latest researches in comparative grammar. The book is eom·
plete, without useless detail.

For the past year I have used this Grammar and Leighton's hessone,
aud with greater satisfaction than I have known in the use of any other
grammar or book of cxercises in Latin. 1 most heartily recommend them
to all carcful instructors in academies and preparatory schools.

The longer and more thoroughly we use Goodwin’s and Allen and Green·
ough's‚ themora deeply we are impressed with their especial and remark·
able litness lor tha work oi a careful preparatory classin school.

Msssns. (insu Bnornnnsz

Gauranum-l dcem Allen and Greenough’s Latin Grammar an ad
mirable hook for college use, and consider it superior to any other with
which I am acquainted. lt is worthy oi high praise. . . . I believe the gon-
eral introduction of this Grammar into our schools and colleges would be
a step sarward toward thorough aud trul y seientific instruction in the Latin
language.
