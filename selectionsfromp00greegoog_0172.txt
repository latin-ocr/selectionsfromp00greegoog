SHORTER POEMS.

Ι. Tun Fnsrr.

Tur. word fasti, properly applied to those days of the year on
which it was permitted (fas) to transact public business, came to
be applied to the Roman Calendar, or systematic arrangement
and classification of the days of each montb. Ovid’s purpose in
this poem was to cast this calendar into a poetic form„ describ·
ing whatever was 'peculiar and characteristic in the Roman usages,
-as festivals and rites‚-and working into it⁴ whatever traditions
and myths were current among the people. The Roman religion
was so meagre in the elements of fable, that its mythology, as p‘re'-
sented in this work,'is hardly more than a clumsy adaptation and
vamping over of Grecian myths. It was, however, as rich in ¹
form and ceremonial, as it was poor in story; and the most valu-
able and original portions of the Fasti are those which describe
fragments of these primitive rites‚ which had managed to survive
the inroad of the more fashionable Greek and Oriental forms of
worship, and still lingered in the community. Some of thern,
indeed, held their own for centuries longer, and some were
transformed and adopted into the Christian calendar.  

Only six books of the Fasti, containing the months from Jan·
uary to June inclusive, are extant It is a much disputed question
whether the other six books have been lost, or were never written.
It is probable that they were written in the rough, but unfinished
at the time of the poet's exile, and never published. At any rate,
there are no citations in ancient authors from any but the first
six books.

The following extracts from the fourth book (April) contain a
description of two very ancient festivals, with the traditional
account of the founding of Rome, introduced in the usual manner
of the poet. '

1. The Festr‘val of Pales (Apri121).

ΟΧ abiit, oriturque Aurora. Parilia poscor:
Non poscor frustra, si favet alma Pales. ,
