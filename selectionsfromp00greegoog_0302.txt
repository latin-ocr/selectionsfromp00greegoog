The Poems of Vtryil. Vol. Ι. The Pastoral Poems and first Six Books
of the AEneid. Edited by J. H. and W. F. Allan and J. B. Greeuough.
(Boston: Ginn Brothers. laval-This volume is in keeping with the high
characteres the editors’ previous publications. It is not ιοο much ιο say,
that with the appearance of their ‘⁴ Latin Grammar,’' iu 1872, began a new
era in the study of the Latin language in America, and perhaps there is no
more encouraging tokcu of tha condition of classical scholarship among ns
than the cordial and intelligent welcome so generally extended to this ad·
vanccd mamral. Their edition of “ Seleoted Orations of Cicero’'in1873
was superior to any which the American student had before had. Α prac-
tical application ol the best results of Latin scholarship and of general
philology, and a clear conciseness of statement, preeminently characterized
both works, aud these are thc qualities which give ιο this edition of Virgil
its great merit. The wealth of comment which has accumulatcd about the
lauguage and thoughts of their author the editors seem to have thoroughly
examiued, without, however, sacrificing a practical and independent spirit
peculiar ιο themselves. Wherevcr a diligent ieamer would be likely ιο
have doubts as to Virgil's exact meaning, or to be puazled by the idioms or
subtlctics of the Latin, there the editors appear with ample help, or, at least,
with a clue ιο the solution. We have been particularly pleased with the
synopses of thought which precede aud accompuny each portion of the
pocms.

From 0. P. F. Bancroft, Pplincipal of Phillips Andover
Aca emy.

We are using Allen and Greenough’s Latin Grammar, aad find it ample
in amount, clcar in statement aud arrangement, suggestivc ol' higlrcr studies
in thc same field, and easy ιο cite,—in short, an excellent school grammar.

From Albert 0. Perka'ns, Mastar Lawrence High, recently
elected Pnin. Phillips Academy, Eneter.

We have used Allen and Greenongh’s Latin Grammar during the past
year with great satisfaction. It answers excellently all tho purposes of a
school-book, aad furnishes much matter not previously accessible to most
pupils. It sccms ιο me to mark a decided advance in Philology, and to
meet vvcll all the wauts of our preparatory schools.
