[Αετττττουε, continuing the discourse‚ tells of the transforma-
tions of Proteus; and os Metra, daughter ol Eresichthou, who
(receiving this power from Neptune) long, by cheats and wiles,
sustained her father cursed with extreme rage of hunger for the
violation of a grove os Ceres (VIII. 725-884). And as Theseus
lnquires the cause os his broken horn, Achelous replies that con·
tending once with Hercules for the possesSion-of Deianira, sister
of Meleager, that horn had been wrested oli} and, being filled by
the Naiads with( autumn fruits, became the horn oi Plenty (IX.
1-100). ln desence os the same Dejanira, Hercules had once
slain the centanr Nessus3 who, dying, gave her a tunic stained
with his blood, mixed with venom of the Lemaean hydra, which <he
said) would recall her husband’s love if ever it should wander or
’ cool(101-133).]

Afterward, Hercules being about to wed Iole, daughter ol Eury·
tus, Dejanira sent to him this tunic as a marriage gift. But when
it took heat from the altar flames as he was about to sacrifice, Her·
cules, being in extreme torment‚ and unable to tear it off, cast into
the sea the bearer of the gift, Lichas, who was converted intoa
rock, retaining his human form (134-227). Then Hercules, build-
ing a great funeral pile upon Mount OEta of Thessaly, burned him-
self thereon; and, his mortal parts being purged away, was
received lnto the company ol the gods (228-272).
