4 Introduction.

is apparently the first attempt os human tlroughtto deal systemati·
cally with the phenomena oi nature- so as, in a manner, to
account for things-before men were sufficiently free from super·
stition to reject the early fables. The titles of several Greek works
of the same kind are known; and Virgil, in the Sixth Eclogue‚ Ἰ
puts a similar song into the mouth of Silenus.

Any thing like a real belief in these {ables had passed away long
before the time of Ovid. He was the popular poet of a ¹sensual
and artificial age, who found in these creatione nt ancient lancy
a group of subjects suited to his graceful, ornate, and marvellously
facile style os narrative, and who did not hesitate to alteror dress
them up to suit his purptise. The “ Metamorphoses ’³ —Libri xv.
Metamorphoseon (a Greek genitive) .-.is the most abundant and
rich collection of these sables that exists. They are told in a
diffuse, sentimental, osten debased way, which contrasts strongly
with the serious meaning that originally belonged to these myths;
but are wonderfullyfluent, easy, and melodious in their language‚ and
show a skill oi versification which seems never to halt or weary.
The poem begins with the first origin of things from chaos, the
sour ages oi gold, silver, brass‚ and iron, the deiuge, followed by the
gracesul and picturesque version of the tales oi gods and heroes,
through a long narrative—about 12,0oo verses in all-ending
with the apotheosis of Caesar, as the sequel of the taleni Troy.
The series purports to be chronologica13 but tbe order is osten
arbitrary and the connection forced or affected, as would naturally
be the case with an author res diversissimas inspeciem unius
corporis colligentem (Quint. iv. 1, 77).

The mythology of Ovid and the other Roman poets was Greek
mythology dressed up in Roman names. itis not necessary to
remind the reader that the stories here told related to Zeus,
Athene, Artemis and the other members of the Greek Olympus,
and could never have been attributed to the sober abstractions os
the Roman Pantheon. Nevertheless‚ in commenting upon Ovid‚
it is impossible to avoid making use nithe names in the- same
sense that he did,—the names long familiar in modern litera-
ture, which took them from the Romans and not the Greeks.
